			We consider a <a href="http://methodology.psu.edu/ra/smart/projects/petry">SMART design</a> for attendance-based prize contingency management for cocaine abuse (N.M. Petry, P.I.). 
			Contingency management is a treatment used in substance abuse in which participants are rewarded for adhering to treatment.
		</p>
		<h4>Motivation</h4>
		Contingency management has been shown to reduce drug use. However, there remain questions regarding optimal strength of reinforcement, as well as the timing and length of CM.
		<h4>Trial Components</h4>
			There are two treatments under study:
			<ol>
				<li> Attendance contingency management (ACM), in which patients are rewarded based on their attendance (or non-attendance) at treatment sessions
				<li> Standard care (SC).
			</ol>
			After 6 weeks of treatment, all participants are re-randomized between ACM and SC. There is no tailoring variable influencing randomization.
			This results in a subset of patients who received varying lengths of ACM, as well as different sequences of ACM and SC.

		<h4>Embedded <em>Non</em>-Adaptive Intervention Paths</h4>
			Notice that, in the absence of a tailoring variable, there are zero embedded adaptive interventions. However, there are four embedded <em>non</em>-adaptive interventions. They are
			<ol>
				<li> "Give ACM for the duration of the study."
				<li> "Give ACM for 6 weeks, then switch to SC."
				<li> "Give SC for 6 weeks, then switch to ACM."
				<li> "Give SC for the duration of the study."
			</ol>
		<h4>Outcome Measures</h4>
			The primary outcome was length of abstinence from cocaine use.
